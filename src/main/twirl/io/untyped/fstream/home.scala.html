    <h3><p>Welcome to Scalaz-Stream Demo Application built with @msg!</p></h3>
    <p>
        The service is running with HTTP4S Blaze Server and connecting it with the Twitter Stream Source.

        We are using Websocket from Http4s as Sink.
    </p>
    <p>
        The code is shamelessly copied from Http4S Demo application available on <a href="https://github.com/http4s/http4s_demo">github</a>.<br/>

        Both http4s and blaze are works in progress: if you find bugs or have suggestions,
        please submit an <a href="https://github.com/http4s/http4s/issues?state=open">issue</a>.
    </p>
